# GitHub-CodeChallenge

Some UI tests for GitHub.

Tools used: Selenide/WebDriver, JUnit4, Gradle.

To build the project you will need Gradle (recommended v3.3 or higher).

Currently only Chrome browser is supported. 

No webdriver binary is needed, as it going to be downloaded automatically (thanks to Selenide feature). This is why Firefox (geckodriver) is not supported at the moment.
